Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.

Every time I solve 5 of the problems, I'll be uploading them here. Eventually, we'll have a mathematical python algorithm bible to refer back to if needed :)
